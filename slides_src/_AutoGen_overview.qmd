## AutoGen for .NET Overview

AutoGen ![](./pics/AutoGen_icon.png){height=60px}

An open-source framework specific for build LLM Agentic AI software, provide both Python & .NET C#:

* Python: <https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/>
* .NET C# porting:
  + (v0.2.x) <https://microsoft.github.io/autogen-for-net/index.html> 
  + (v0.4dev) <https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/dotnet/dev/>

:::{.callout-important}
It will also as [**Semnantic Kernel**](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel), being replaced by [**Microsoft Agent Framework**](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) in near future:<br/>
<https://devblogs.microsoft.com/foundry/introducing-microsoft-agent-framework-the-open-source-engine-for-agentic-ai-apps/>
:::

And because of that, another related open source project [**AG2: Open-Source AgentOS for AI Agents**](https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2) is started to provide a truly "Open-Source" Agentic AI framework.

## AutoGen design concepts {.small .scrollable}

AutoGen (Python) is designed to simplify the development of agentic AI applications by providing:

* **Agent**:<br/>Autonomous entities that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with other agents or users.
* **Agent Runtime Environment**:<br/>Standalone or Distributed runtime environment, facilitates communication between agents, manages their identities and lifecycles, and enforce security and privacy boundaries.
   ![](./pics/application-stack.svg)<br/>So it is possible to run agents across multiple machines:<br/>![](./pics/architecture-distributed.svg)<br/>
* **Memory**:<br/>Included in ["AgentChat" package](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/agentchat-user-guide/index.html), Mechanisms for agents to retain and recall information, facilitating long-term interactions and learning.
* **Messaging**:<br/>Provids Topic and Subscription ways for either direct or broadcast communication between agents.
* **Tool Use**:<br/>Enables agents to utilize external tools and APIs to enhance their capabilities and perform complex tasks.
* **Workbench**:<br/>Provides a collection of Tools for agents to use, including [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).
* **Logging & Monitoring**:<br/>Built-in support for logging and monitoring agent activities via [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), aiding in debugging and performance analysis.
* **Group Chat/Workflow**:<br/>Supports multi-agent various types of group chat and workflow orchestration, enabling complex interactions and collaborations among agents.

## AutoGen for .NET features {.small .scrollable}

Since the AutoGen for .NET (C#) is a porting from Python ones, its features are much limited and partial:<br/>(And only the v0.2.x is a complete porting)

* **Agent Framework**:<br/>Create autonomous agents that either is code logic based or LLM powered.
* **Typed Message**:<br/>Utilizes C# strong typing to define message structures, enhancing code reliability and maintainability.
* **Middlewares**:<br/>Support for middlewares to intercept and process messages between agents, enabling custom behaviors and functionalities.
* **Group Chat**:<br/>Only have two types of group chat: [Round-Robin & Dynamic](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen-for-net/articles/Group-chat-overview.html).
* **Tool Use**:<br/>Agents can use tools (Function call) either by [defined in C# type-safe function code via **AutoGen.SourceGenerator** package](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen-for-net/articles/Create-type-safe-function-call.html) or [using **Microsoft.Extensions.AI** library wrapped .NET functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/ai/quickstarts/use-function-calling).
